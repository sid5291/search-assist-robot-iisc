Steps for U-boot modification:

First please refer the Beagleboard Refernce Manual page No. 108 for a refernce of all the states that each pin can take.

then type 

MACHINE=beagleboard bitbake -c configure u-boot

Then enter :
setup-scripts/buid/tmp-*/work/beagleboard/u-boot-*/git/board/ti/beagle/

edit beagle.h :
To your preference

for example:
 
MUX_VAL(CP(MMC1_DAT7),		(IEN  | PTU | EN  | M0))

the M0 represents the mode that is set at boot - change this to M4 for GPIO or any other depending on your requirement 

Similarly do the same for evm.h in:

setup-scripts/buid/tmp-*/work/beagleboard/u-boot-*/git/board/ti/evm/

after this do:

MACHINE=beagleboard bitbake -c compile u-boot

and enter:

setup-scripts/buid/tmp-*/work/beagleboard/u-boot-*/git/

and copy the 

MLO and u-boot.bin file to the SD card.

Next we need to disable the kernel pin mux configuration:

execute

MACHINE=beagleboard bitbake -c menuconfig virtual/kernel

In the Terminal 
1. Enter the System Type menu
2. Then TI OMAP Common Features
3. Highlight OMAP multiplexing support
4. and press 'N' 

This will disable the Kernel Multiplexing support and enable the U-boot mux at boot.

Now compile the kernel , bitbake console image and extract the tarball on to the SD card.
